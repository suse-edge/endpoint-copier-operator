# endpoint-copier-operator
This is a Kubernetes operator whose purpose is to keep the Endpoint Slices of a Kubernetes Service in sync with another Kubernetes Service.

This is being used on the SUSE Edge product to expose the Kubernetes API on High Availability scenarios.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
Deploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
helm repo add suse-edge https://suse-edge.github.io/charts
helm install --create-namespace -n endpoint-copier-operator endpoint-copier-operator suse-edge/endpoint-copier-operator
```

Create a Kubernetes Service:

```sh
cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-vip
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    endpoint-copier/enabled: "true"
    endpoint-copier/default-service-name: "kubernetes"
    endpoint-copier/default-service-namespace: "default"
spec:
  internalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  ipFamilies:
  - IPv4
  ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack
  ports:
  - name: rke2-api
    port: 9345
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9345
  - name: k8s-api
    port: 6443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 6443
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: LoadBalancer
EOF
```

### Uninstall controller
Uninstall the controller from the cluster:

```sh
helm -n endpoint-copier-operator uninstall endpoint-copier-operator
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

## How SUSE Edge uses endpoint-copier-operator

The first SUSE Edge RKE2/K3s control plane node is deployed with an extra `--tls-san` [parameter](https://docs.rke2.io/reference/server_config#listener) for an extra IP (and "hostname") that will be used to expose the Kubernetes API. That parameter instructs RKE2/K3s to create the Kubernetes API certificates with that extra IP and hostname. To be able to deploy [MetalLB](https://metallb.io/) to perform the load balancing, the default 'servicelb' service is [disabled](https://metallb.io/configuration/k3s/).

Then MetalLB is deployed as well as an `IPAddressPool` and the corresponding `L2Advertisement` objects (or the `BGPAdvertisment`) for the K8s VIP.

RKE2/K3s default `kubernetes` service endpoints are the 'Ready' control plane nodes IPs, so an extra `kubernetes-vip` service (type: loadbalancer) is created to behave just like the default kubernetes service does. E-C-O keeps in sync the `kubernetes-vip` `EndpointSlices` with the default `kubernetes` service. In the event of a control-plane node going down, it goes down on both `kubernetes` and `kubernetes-vip` services, so it is _out_ of the load balancing procedure. Same if a new control-plane node goes up, it will be reflected as well.

Note: All the required objects and settings are automatically performed via combustion at installation time via [edge-image-builder](https://github.com/suse-edge/edge-image-builder/) when adding >1 hosts to the [Kubernetes section of the EIB configuration file](https://github.com/suse-edge/edge-image-builder/blob/main/docs/building-images.md#kubernetes).
