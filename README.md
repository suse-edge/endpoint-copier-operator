# endpoint-copier-operator
This is an Kubernetes operator whose purpose is to create a copy of a Kubernetes Service and Endpoint and to keep them synced.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
Deploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
helm install --create-namespace -n endpoint-copier-operator endpoint-copier-operator helm/endpoint-copier-operator
```

Create a Kubernetes Service:

```sh
cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-vip
  namespace: default
spec:
  internalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  ipFamilies:
  - IPv4
  ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack
  ports:
  - name: rke2-api
    port: 9345
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9345
  - name: k8s-api
    port: 6443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 6443
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: LoadBalancer
EOF
```

### Uninstall controller
Uninstall the controller from the cluster:

```sh
helm -n endpoint-copier-operator uninstall endpoint-copier-operator
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
